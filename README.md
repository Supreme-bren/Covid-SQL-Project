# Covid Project
-Welcome to my Data Visualization project. A project that I created that displays Covid data around the world for the last 4 years
The data was excracted and manipulated in SQL Server Manaagment Studio using SQL, and the dashboard and data visualizations 
were created using Tableu. My Covid Dashboard allows you to anaylze the impact that Covid and it's vaccines have had on the health and well being of people .
The dashboard shows information like "Musuems Per Capita", "Revenue Per Capita",
and breaking up the musuems into types and showcasing how many exist in each state in the United States.
