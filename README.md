# Covid Project
-Welcome to my Data Visualization project. A project that I created that displays Covid data around the world for the last 4 years
The data was excracted and manipulated in SQL Server Manaagment Studio using SQL, and the dashboard and data visualizations 
were created using Tableu. My Covid Dashboard allows you to anaylze the impact that Covid has had on peoples' lives and how that impact 
varied depending on geographical location. Similarly we analyzed the impact that vaccinations have had on the reduction and fatality of Covid
cases as well has how total vaccinations varied from country to country.
The dashboard showcases information like "Total Death Count" cause by Covid, "Percent Population Infected By Country", and  overall global covid numbers
